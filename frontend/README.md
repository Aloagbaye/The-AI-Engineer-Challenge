# 🚀 OpenAI Chat Frontend

Welcome to your shiny new OpenAI Chat UI! This is a Next.js app designed for chatting with OpenAI models, with a beautiful blue background and a focus on great UX.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start chatting!

## ✨ Features
- Blue, visually clear chat interface
- Enter your OpenAI API key securely (never stored!)
- Model selection (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Real-time streaming responses
- Responsive and pleasant UX

## 🧠 Notes
- You need your own OpenAI API key to chat.
- The backend FastAPI server must be running for the chat to work (see `../api/app.py`).
- This app is ready for Vercel deployment, but works great locally too!

Happy chatting! If you break it, you get to keep both pieces. 😄
